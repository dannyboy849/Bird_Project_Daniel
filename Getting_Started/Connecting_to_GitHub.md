# This is strongly recommended to backup your data - you can actually upload the entirety of your Project to a repository! 

### Before continuing, it is important to note that you need a GitHub account already set up.

## Step 1: Installing GitHub on Linux (Debian)
- Run this command to pull GitHub onto your repository
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git
```

- This it! You now should see GitHub running this command:
```bash

```

- You can refer to the link below if needed:

    <a href="https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03#file-linux-md">GitHub</a>
</li>

## Step 2: Generate a SSH key
- In the command line, navigate to the directory where you would like to create a local clone of your new project (I recommend inside of your project folder)
```bash
gh repo create
```
- To create a repository for your project, use the gh repo create subcommand. When prompted, select Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch and enter the name of your new project. If you want your project to belong to an organization instead of to your personal account, specify the organization name and project name with organization-name/project-name.
- Follow the interactive prompts. To clone the repository locally, confirm yes when asked if you would like to clone the remote project directory.

## Step 3: Creating a repository

## Step 4: Adding a key
- This lets create what's called an *access key* and it lets you access your repository from your device. Make a note that it only works for **this particular device**. If you wish to access the same repository on another device, you have to repeat the *access key* process.

## Step 5:

## Step 6:

## Step 7:

```bash

```
<li class="masthead__menu-item">
    <a href=""></a>
</li>
# Done! Now you can back all of your data safely. Next, we move onto creating our docker container.
