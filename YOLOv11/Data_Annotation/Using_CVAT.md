# Setting up CVAT 
CVAT is very simple and intuitive to use. However, you will need to install google chrome as it is not supported by Firefox or any other browser. 

## Step 1. Create a CVAT acount
First thing you’ll do is create an account in CVAT. I recommend personal accounts, but I'm unsure if this affects organization and inviting other users. 

## Step 2. Create a Project
You’ll select “Create Project” 

## Step 3. Create Task
Make a Task

## Step 4. Assign Task
You’ll assign the task to someone (yourself) 

## Step 5. Upload Raw Images
Upload your dataset (raw images) and add your labels. We used .PNG images

## Step 6. Manually Annotate
Then, you’ll simply go through your entire dataset and manually annotate (you only have to do this once, but the more annotated data you have, the more accurate your model will be) 

## Step 7. Export your annotations!
Finally, to export your data will depend on which software you wish you use: (in our case, YOLO uses .txt, so we used the YOLO 1.1 option at the very bottom) 

# Data annotation is done! Onto uploading your work into YOLOvx
