# This serves as a start-from-finish guide for YOLO training
This is all in your bash terminal, but modifying any of the files inside YOLO will be in Python. Good Luck!

### First, I would like to give credit to my co-researcher, Mathis Morales, for their repository that helped tremendously with setting up the Docker Container!
```bash
https://github.com/airou-lab/Docker-GPU-Tutorial.git
```

## Begin With Getting_Started
- Installing_Ubuntu24.04
- Using_Ubuntu24.04

## Continue With Docker_Installation
- Docker_Image
- Docker_Container

## Image_Conversion
You only have to do this if your images are in video format.

## Finally, YOLOv11
- Data_Annotation
- YOLOv11_Build

# Done! Congratulations, and good luck!


# Bird_Project_Daniel
This is also my repository where I upload all of my experimental results. I will mainly use this as a backup for my files, but also as a free dataset for anyone who wants to work with my datasets. If there is anything missing or that needs clarification, please feel free to reach out to me at dvargas88@ou.edu. Hope this helps!!


# Summary Results
For YOLOv5, our results of Camera 1 was 54% precison and 23.4% accurate in IoU (mAP-95)

For the results of Camera 3, our accuracy was 64% and 27.3% accurate in IoU (mAP-95)

I will be testing on YOLOv11 soon - working on complicated installation. 

- Complicated installation completed! We now have an accuracy using simultaneous tracking-and-classification of 71.4% for both camera angles! BUT, our tracking-THEN-classification acheived 87.5% accuracy! Hooray for StackExchange!
