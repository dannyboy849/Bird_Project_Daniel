# This serves as a from-scratch guide from start to finish for YOLO training
## Begin With Getting_Started
- Installing_Ubuntu24.04
- Using_Ubuntu24.04

## Continue With Docker_Installation
- Docker_Image
- Docker_Container

## Image_Conversion
You only have to do this if your images are in video format.

## Finally, YOLOv11
- Data_Annotation
- YOLOv11_Build

# Done! Congratulations, and good luck!

# Bird_Project_Daniel
This is also my repository where I upload all of my files mainly as a backup, but also to be easily accessible for anyone who wants to work on it/borrow my data. If there is anything missing or needs clarification, please feel free to reach out to me here, or preferably at dvargas88@ou.edu. Hope this helps!!

# Results
As of now, our best results for Camera 1 are 54% precison and 23.4% accurate in IoU. This, of course, is without the aid of semantic segmentation which is likely to boost the accuracy to ~70% or higher.
Our best results for Camera 3 are 64% precison and 27.3% accurate in IoU (mAP-50-95)

Will be testing on Yolov11 soon - working on complicated installation. 

- Complicated installation completed! We now have an accuracy using simultaneous tracking-and-classification of 71.4%! BUT, our tracking-THEN-classification acheived 87.5% accuracy! Hooray for StackExchange!
