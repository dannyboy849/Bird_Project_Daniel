This will be my repository where I upload all of my files mainly as a backup, but also to be easily accessible for anyone who wants to work on it/borrow my data. If there is anything missing(although only the Airlab team has access as of now) or needs clarification, please feel free to reach out to me here, or preferably at dvargas88@ou.edu. Hope this helps!

As of now, our best results for Camera 1 are 54% precison and 23.4% accurate in IoU. This, of course, is without the aid of semantic segmentation which is likely to boost the accuracy to ~70% or higher.
Our best results for Camera 3 are 64% precison and 27.3% accurate in IoU (mAP-50-95)

Will be testing on Yolov11 soon - working on complicated installation. 

- Complicated installation completed! We now have an accuracy using simultaneous tracking-and-classification of 71.4%! BUT, our tracking-THEN-classification acheived 87.5% accuracy! Hooray for StackExchange!
