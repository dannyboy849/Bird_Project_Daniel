Results for Experiment 2 were 47%, 22.6% on untrained data. This included Albumentation (augmenting software) which improved the accuracy.

Precision (P):

    Male: The precision for male instances has improved to 0.544, which is a solid increase.
    Female: Precision for females has decreased slightly to 0.411, which could indicate the model is being more conservative with female predictions to avoid false positives.

Recall (R):

    Male: Recall for males is now 0.697, a significant improvement, showing that the model is now detecting more male instances.
    Female: Recall for females has increased to 0.531, showing that the model is identifying more female instances than before.

mAP50:

    Overall mAP50 is 0.47, which is a solid result, and it's showing good performance at the 50% IoU threshold.
    Male: mAP50 for males is 0.487, which is an excellent improvement.
    Female: mAP50 for females is 0.454, which is a bit lower than for males but still reasonable.

mAP50-95:

    The overall mAP50-95 has increased to 0.226, suggesting that the model is also improving at higher IoU thresholds, although there's still room for improvement, especially for male instances.

Very poor results. Recommended to train with more epochs (was on 100, try 1000)
